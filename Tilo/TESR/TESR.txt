§2  Overview
============

The Tilo Engine Sprite Resource file format (TESR) can be used to store images
or animations and additional shader data, e.g. normal maps.

The file name of a TESR file should end with ".tesr" (without quotes).

A TESR file is encoded using big endian.

A TESR file is made up of 3 different sections,
which are stored in a continuous stream of bytes, without any slack space:
* Header
* Metadata
* Data

§2.1  Header
------------

The header section stores the magic number of the file.

§2.2  Metadata
--------------

The metadata section stores information about the actual data:
* Version of the file format
* Width of all frames
* Height of all frames
* Frame rate
* Information about the channels used

§2.3  Data
----------

The data sections stores the actual image data, encapsulated inside a gzip compressed
TAR container.


§3  Header Section
==================

The header section
must always be the following four bytes (in hexadecimal notation):
54, 45, 53, 52


§4  Metadata Section
====================

The metadata section
is made up of five different parts (see §1.2),
which are stored in a continuous stream of bytes, without any slack space.

§4.1  Version
-------------

The first part of the metadata section
stores the version of the file format.
It consists of two bytes, each of them interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer.

The first byte must be (in hexadecimal notation):
01
The second byte must be (in hexadecimal notation):
00

§4.2  Frame width
-----------------

The second part of the metadata section
stores the width of all frames in pixels.
It consists of four bytes, which are interpreted as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

§4.3  Frame height
------------------

The third part of the metadata section stores the height of all frames in pixels.
It consists of four bytes, which are interpreted as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

§4.4  Frame rate
----------------

The fourth part of the metadata section
stores the frame rate of the animation in frames per second.
It consists of four bytes, which are interpreted as an IEEE 754 32-bit floating point number.
The frame rate must always be a positive number or zero.
The frame rate must not be positive infinity.

If the frame rate is greater than zero,
the data is handled as an animation.
If the frame rate is exactly zero,
the data is handled as an image
and only the first frame is used.

§4.5  Channel information
-------------------------

The fifth part of the metadata section
stores information about the channels that are used in the image or animation.

It consists of at least 3 bytes,
which are stored in a continuous stream of bytes, without any slack space:
* Number of channels
* Bit depth information
[...]
* Channel 1 information
[...]

§4.5.1  First byte
The first byte
is interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer
and stores the number of channels used.
It must be greater than 0.

§4.5.2  Bit depth information
After the first byte
follow as many bytes as required to assign
one bit to every channel.

These bits are stored in the same sequence as
the channel information bytes. [See §4.5.3]

If a bit is 0, the corresponding channel uses a bit depth of 8 bits.
If a bit is 1, the corresponding channel uses a bit depth of 16 bits.

§4.5.3  Following bytes
After the bit depth information byte(s)
follow at least as many bytes as there are channels.

Information about one distinct channel
is stored in one byte,
except when this byte is (in hexadecimal notation)
ff
, then another byte dedicated to that channel follows.

§4.5.3.1  First info byte
The first byte of the distinct channel information
is interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer.
Each channel type has a number.

[See §6.1]

A channel of the type this number corresponds to
must be present in the image or animation.

§4.5.3.2  Second info byte
The second byte of the distinct channel information
is interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer.
It must not be present
if the first info byte does not correlate to the channel type
CUSTOM
.

It specifies the ID of a custom channel.


§5  Data section
================

The data section
consists of the raw content of a gzip compressed
(MIME Type: application/gzip)
TAR archive file
(MIME Type: application/x-tar).

The gzip container contains a TAR archive file called "D" (without quoted).

This archive file consists of multiple files, which each store one channel of one frame.

§5.1  Naming convention
-----------------------
All files of the archive follow a specific naming convention:
Each file name starts with one letter describing the channel type,
followed by a number in hexadecimal notation describing the frame number.

§5.1.1  Channel types
There are 19 different native channel types.
Each channel type has one letter associated with it
which is used in the file names of the archive files.

[See §6.1]

The file name of each file
must begin with a channel letter,
which corresponding channel type
must be specified
in the channel information part
of the metadata section.

If the channel type the channel letter corresponds to is
CUSTOM
and the ID of that channel is smaller than (in hexadecimal notation)
10
, the channel letter is followed by a
0
and the ID of that channel in lowercase hexadecimal notation. [See §6.2]

If the channel type the channel letter corresponds to is
CUSTOM
and the ID of that channel is greater than or equals (in hexadecimal notation)
10
, the channel letter is followed by
the ID of that channel in lowercase hexadecimal notation. [See §6.2]

§5.1.2  Frame number
The frame number
is stored in lowercase hexadecimal notation without leading zeros
directly after the channel type.

The first frame has the frame number 0.
The frame number of a frame that is not the first frame
is one higher than the frame number of the previous frame.

[See §6.2]

§5.2  File contents
-------------------

The image data
is stored as a stream of bytes.

Pixels are stored line by line,
from top to bottom,
where each line is stored from left to right.

Each one or two bytes,
depending on the bit depth,
stands for one pixel
and is interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer,
except at the beginning of a new image line,
where an extra byte is inserted,
which is also interpreted as an unsigned 8-bit integer
and is used to mark the interpretation mode
of the following row.

[See §6.3]

Each pixel has a raw value r,
that is used to calculate the actual value v,
depending on the interpretation mode,
and a bit depth d.

If the interpretation mode is LITERAL,
the following formula applies:
v(r) = r

If the interpretation mode is LEFT,
the following formula applies
(with vl being the value v of the pixel to the left,
or 0, if there is no pixel to the left):
v(r, vl) = (r + rl) mod d

If the interpretation mode is RIGHT,
the following formula applies
(with vr being the value v of the pixel to the right,
or 0, if there is no pixel to the right):
v(r, vr) = (r + vr) mod d

If the interpretation mode is TOP,
the following formula applies
(with vu being the value v of the pixel to the top,
or 0, if there is no pixel to the top):
v(r, vu) = (r + vu) mod d
