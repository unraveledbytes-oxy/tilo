The "Tilo Engine Sprite Resource" file format (TESR) is designed to be used by the game engine "Tilo Engine" internally.
It only consists of a small amount of metadata and a BZip2 container, so all security considerations of the BZip2 file format (MIME Type: application/x-bzip2) also apply to the TESR file format.
=
Technically, the TESR file format can be used across all operating systems, because it is made up of raw data and does not rely on platform-specific features (e.g. line-feeds).
It is designed to be used by the game engine "Tilo Engine", but due to its open-source specification, it may also be used by other applications.
